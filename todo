let us dicuss first, always use chinese to explain but code not chinese. withoutmy permission dont change my code. 

1. Have the embedding optimized?
    yes, but reject too much
        - first try: beginiing at lower eta 
2. multi init start for optimize
3. expasion num N is fixed, but init expansion num is N//target_success_rate. 
4. one question is the add directions to embedding, optimize is not deeply. change is not enough
    For example, {
  "0": {
    "initial_sentence": "She accused him of being so stingy at parties, never offering to split the bill.",
    "random": {
      "alpha": 4.453125,
      "text": [
        "She accused him of being too stingy at parties, claiming he never would split the bill.",
        "She accused him of being stingy at parties, claiming he never would split the bill.",
        "She accused him of being too stingy at parties, claiming he never would split the bill."
      ]
    }
  }
    }
    consider mask each embedding ang generate:
     - if classify no change, then mask this embedding
